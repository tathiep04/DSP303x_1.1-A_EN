    "## Lab Introduction\n",
    "Growing up, everyone has a hero. For many people, that hero was Muhammad Ali. He taught people it was okay to be proud of who they were, at a time when others would not accept that. He showed people how to stand up for their beliefs in the face of oppression and tyranny. He made people value themselves, and encouraged them care for those around them. He showed us what bravery truly meant, how to be a heck of a boxer, and so much more. Every single person who met Muhammad Ali, either in the ring or outside of it, had a motivating story to share about their encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 3, 2016, Muhammad Ali passed away at the age of 74 due to septic shock. Thirty years earlier, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome, a neurodegenerative condition that doctors attributed to his boxing-related brain injuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parkinson's disease itself is a long-term disorder of the nervous system that affects many aspects of a person's mobility over time. It's characterized by shaking, slowed movement, rigidity, dementia, and depression. In 2013, some 53 million people were diagnosed with it, mostly men. Other famous personalities affected by it include actor Michael J. Fox, and olympic cyclist Davis Phinney.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be applying SVC to the [Parkinson's Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinsons), provided courtesy of UCI's Machine Learning Repository. The dataset was created at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with 10 medical centers around the US, along with Intel who developed the device used to record the primary features of the dataset: speech signals. Your goals for this lab are first to see if it's possible to differentiate between people who have Parkinson's and who don't using SciKit-Learn's support vector classifier, and then to take a first-stab at a naive way of fine-tuning your parameters in an attempt to maximize the accuracy of your testing set.\n",

Also, you might unknowingly skip a pair of values that would have resulted in a very good accuracy.\n",

As you know, Python ranges won't allow for float intervals, so you'll have to do some research on NumPy ARanges, if you don't already know how to use them.\n",

Train and score the model appropriately. If the current best_score is less than the model's score, update the best_score being sure to print it out, along with the C and gamma values that resulted in it.\n",
